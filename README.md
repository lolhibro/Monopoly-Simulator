# Monopoly-Simulator
Simulate a terminal-based monopoly game with predetermined assigned properties

This is a user-friendly program that randomly initializes and assigns monopoly title deeds to a set number of players and runs a game to see who comes out on top. This code be modified to set each player with very specific title deeds if you would like to run different kinds of scnarios or experiments (I've made note of where in the .py file).

Also added a hot seat multiplayer option.
